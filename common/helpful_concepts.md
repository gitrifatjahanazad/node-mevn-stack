### REST Representational State Transfer

>  When the server receives the request and pulls data from storage, it does not simply return the database resources as a response. It sends a representation of these resources. That's why it is called representational. When the server responds to the client with this formatted data, the state of our application changes. And that's why it's called state transfer.
